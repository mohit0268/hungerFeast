#React Hooks
-Normal JS utility function

-useState()
-useEffect()
  -It accepts 2 arguments which is callback function and dependency array(it controls when the effect should run);
  -call back function is called as soon as the render cycle ends
  -Three scenarios of using dependency array inside useEffect
    -if no dependency array is present => useEffect is called on Every render 
    -if the dependency array is empty => useEffect is called on initial Render(just once when the component render for the first time)\
    -if the dependency array is containing component => useEffect is called everytime mentioned component gets updated
